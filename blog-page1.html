                    Cairo Internation Film Festival (CIFF) is an annual festival that takes place in Cairo every year.
                     It gives young filmakers the chance to present their work in several screens across Egypt to offer
                      them the chance to be seen and present their talents in direction and story telling.

                <p>
                    <span>I had the chance to attend a number of films created by those young artists and get inspiration from
                     them and their experiences.</span>
                    One thing that I was able to recognise in most of the films is that the more personal the film gets 
                    the more the director is able to reach the audience in the simplest ways. The reason why I totaly agree 
                    with this is that we can express what we feel through showing but not telling in onses own artistic style. 
                     This is a lesson that I will be putting into consideration in the upcoming projects that will be made.
